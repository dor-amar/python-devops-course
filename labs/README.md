# Python Programming Labs

This directory contains a series of hands-on labs designed to help you learn Python programming from basics to advanced concepts. Each lab focuses on specific topics and includes exercises, examples, and tests.

## Lab Structure

Each lab is organized in its own directory with the following structure:
```
lab_XX_topic/
├── README.md           # Lab instructions and requirements
├── exercises/          # Exercise files
├── solutions/          # Solution files
└── tests/             # Test files
```

## How to Use These Labs

1. Start with the lab that matches your current skill level
2. Read the README.md file in each lab directory for instructions
3. Complete the exercises in the `exercises/` directory
4. Run the tests to verify your solutions
5. Check the solutions in the `solutions/` directory if you need help

## Lab Progression

The labs are designed to progress from basic to advanced concepts:

1. Basic Python Syntax and Data Types
2. Control Structures (if/else, loops)
3. Functions and Modules
4. Object-Oriented Programming
5. File Handling and Data Processing
6. Error Handling and Debugging
7. Advanced Topics (Decorators, Generators, etc.)

## Running Tests

Each lab includes test files to verify your solutions. To run the tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:
1. Review the lab's README.md for hints
2. Check the solution files
3. Ask your instructor for guidance

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of command line operations
