# Lab 02: Control Structures

This lab introduces you to Python's control structures, including conditional statements (if/else) and loops (for and while). You'll learn how to make decisions in your code and repeat operations efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Use if/else statements for decision making
- Implement different types of loops (for and while)
- Work with nested control structures
- Use break and continue statements
- Create menu-driven programs

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Number Classification
Create a program that:
1. Takes a number as input
2. Classifies it as:
   - Positive, negative, or zero
   - Even or odd
   - Prime or composite
3. Uses nested if/else statements for classification

### Exercise 2: Pattern Printing
Create a program that:
1. Takes a number as input
2. Prints different patterns using nested loops:
   - A right-angled triangle
   - A pyramid
   - A hollow square
3. Uses different loop types (for and while)

### Exercise 3: Menu-Driven Calculator
Create a calculator program that:
1. Shows a menu of operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
2. Takes user input for operation and numbers
3. Performs the selected operation
4. Continues until the user chooses to exit
5. Uses while loop for menu repetition
6. Handles invalid inputs gracefully

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pytest (for running tests)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `exercises` directory
2. Create your Python files for each exercise
3. Run the tests to verify your solutions:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Tips

- Use proper indentation for control structures
- Consider using elif for multiple conditions
- Use break and continue statements when appropriate
- Remember to handle edge cases and invalid inputs
- Use meaningful variable names for loop counters

## Submission

Submit your completed exercise files in the `exercises` directory. Make sure all tests pass before submitting.
