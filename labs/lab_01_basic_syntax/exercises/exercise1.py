Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types

In this exercise, you will:
1. Declare variables of different types
2. Print their values and types
3. Perform basic arithmetic operations
"""

# TODO: Declare variables of different types
# - An integer variable named 'age' with value 25
# - A float variable named 'height' with value 1.75
# - A string variable named 'name' with value "Python Learner"
# - A boolean variable named 'is_student' with value True

# TODO: Print each variable and its type using the type() function
# Example: print(f"Variable: {variable}, Type: {type(variable)}")

# TODO: Perform basic arithmetic operations
# - Add age and height (convert height to integer)
# - Multiply age by 2
# - Divide height by 2
# Print the results of each operation
