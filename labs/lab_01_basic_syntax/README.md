# Lab 01: Basic Python Syntax and Data Types

This lab introduces you to the fundamental concepts of Python programming, including variables, data types, and basic operations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Declare and use variables
- Work with different data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Perform basic arithmetic operations
- Use string manipulation
- Understand type conversion

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types
Create a Python script that:
1. Declares variables of different types (integer, float, string, boolean)
2. Prints each variable and its type
3. Performs basic arithmetic operations between variables

### Exercise 2: String Manipulation
Create a script that:
1. Takes a string input from the user
2. Converts it to uppercase
3. Reverses the string
4. Counts the number of vowels in the string

### Exercise 3: Type Conversion
Create a script that:
1. Takes a number as a string input
2. Converts it to different numeric types (int, float)
3. Performs calculations with the converted numbers
4. Handles potential conversion errors

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pytest (for running tests)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `exercises` directory
2. Create your Python files for each exercise
3. Run the tests to verify your solutions:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Tips

- Use the `type()` function to check variable types
- Remember to handle user input carefully
- Use string methods like `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`
- Consider using try-except blocks for error handling

## Submission

Submit your completed exercise files in the `exercises` directory. Make sure all tests pass before submitting.
