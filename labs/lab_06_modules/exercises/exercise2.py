Exercise 2: Working with Packages

In this exercise, you'll create a simple package for managing a library system.
You'll practice organizing code into modules within a package.

TODO:
1. Create a package called 'library' with the following structure:
   library/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── books.py
   ├── members.py
   └── utils.py

2. In books.py, create:
   - class Book with attributes:
     * title: str
     * author: str
     * isbn: str
     * available: bool
   - Function to search books by title or author

3. In members.py, create:
   - class Member with attributes:
     * name: str
     * member_id: str
     * borrowed_books: list
   - Functions for borrowing and returning books

4. In utils.py, create:
   - Function to generate unique IDs for books and members
   - Function to validate ISBN numbers

5. In __init__.py:
   - Import and expose the main classes and functions
   - Define __all__ to control what gets imported with 'from library import *'

Example usage:
    from library import Book, Member
    
    book = Book("Python Programming", "John Smith", "123-456-789")
    member = Member("Alice Johnson", "M001")
    
    member.borrow_book(book)
    member.return_book(book)
