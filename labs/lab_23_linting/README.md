# Lab 23: Python Code Linting and Formatting

This lab focuses on Python code quality tools, specifically Black for code formatting and Flake8 for linting. It covers code style enforcement, formatting rules, and best practices for maintaining clean Python code.

## Requirements

1. Create a module for Black formatting with the following features:
   - Code formatting rules
   - Line length configuration

   - Ignore patterns
   - Error reporting
   - Integration with Black

3. Create a module for advanced code quality features that includes:
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - CI/CD integration
   - Custom rule creation
   - Multiple tool integration
   - Code quality reporting
