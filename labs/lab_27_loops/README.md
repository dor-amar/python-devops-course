# Lab 27: Python Loops - For and While

This lab introduces you to Python's loop system. You'll learn how to use different types of loops, control flow statements, and implement various loop patterns to solve programming problems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Use for and while loops effectively
- Implement loop control statements (break, continue)
- Create nested loop patterns
- Use loops for data processing and file operations
- Understand loop optimization and best practices
- Implement common loop patterns and algorithms

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Loop Operations
Create a program that:
1. Uses a for loop to print the first 10 even numbers
2. Uses a while loop to find the factorial of a given number
3. Implements a loop that prints a multiplication table for numbers 1-5
4. Creates a loop that reverses a string without using built-in reverse methods

### Exercise 2: Loop Control and Patterns
Create a program that:
1. Uses break and continue statements to find prime numbers up to 100
2. Implements a nested loop pattern to create a pyramid of numbers
3. Uses loops to find the largest palindrome product of two 3-digit numbers
4. Creates a loop that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms

### Exercise 3: Practical Applications
Create a program that:
1. Uses loops to process a text file and count word frequencies
2. Implements a simple number guessing game using while loops
3. Creates a loop that generates a calendar for a given month
4. Uses loops to implement a simple calculator with continuous operation

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pytest (for running tests)
- rich (for enhanced output formatting)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `exercises` directory
2. Create your Python files for each exercise
3. Run the tests to verify your solutions:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Tips

- Choose appropriate loop types based on the problem
- Consider loop efficiency and optimization
- Handle edge cases and input validation
- Use meaningful variable names
- Document your code with clear comments
- Test your solutions with different input values

## Submission

Submit your completed exercise files in the `exercises` directory. Make sure all tests pass before submitting.
