# **Working with Dictionaries**

### 1. Count the Frequency of Each Word in a List

```python
# Create a function that takes a list of words and returns a dictionary
# showing how many times each word appears in the list.
# Hint: Use a loop and the .get() method.

```

---

### 2. Find Common Elements Between Two Dictionaries

```python
# Create a function that takes two dictionaries as input.
# Return a new dictionary with keys that appear in both dictionaries,
# and for each common key, store both values as a tuple.

```

---

### 3. Calculate the Sum of All Integer Values in a Dictionary

```python
# Write a function that takes a dictionary with mixed value types.
# Sum and return only the values that are integers.
# Hint: Use isinstance(value, int) inside a loop or comprehension.

```

---

### 4. Count Word Frequencies in a Sentence

```python
# Create a function that takes a sentence string.
# Split the sentence into words and count how many times each word appears.
# Return the frequency dictionary.
# Tip: Make everything lowercase to avoid duplication.

```

---

### 5. Swap Keys and Values in a Dictionary

```python
# Write a function that receives a dictionary.
# Create and return a new dictionary with keys and values swapped.
# Assume all values are unique.

```

---

### 6. Sort Dictionary Keys Based on Values (Descending)

```python
# Create a function that takes a dictionary.
# Return a list of keys sorted by their associated values in descending order.

```

---

### 7. Sort a List of Dictionaries Based on a Specific Key
```python
# Given a list of dictionaries (e.g., representing people with "name" and "age"),
# write a function that sorts the list by the value of a specified key.
# For example: sort by "age".

```
