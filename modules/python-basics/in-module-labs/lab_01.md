# **Python Basics: Lab 1 â€“ Variables, Data Types, and Strings**

### Solve the following 20 questions using code:

---

**Question 1:** What is the data type of the variable `my_string` when you assign it the value `"Hello, World!"`?

**Question 2:** If you have two variables, `num1` and `num2`, both containing integer values, how can you calculate their sum and store it in a variable called `sum_result`?

**Question 3:** When you create a variable `my_float` with the value `3.14`, what data type does `my_float` represent?

**Question 4:** If you define a variable `my_bool` with the value `True`, what is the data type of `my_bool`?

**Question 5:** Given the string `my_string = "Python"`, how do you extract and print the character `'t'` from `my_string` using indexing?

**Question 6:** When you multiply two floating-point numbers, `num1` and `num2`, what should you do to calculate their product and store it in a variable called `product_result`?

**Question 7:** Create a string variable `name` with your name. How can you concatenate it with the string `" is a Python programmer"` and print the combined message?

**Question 8:** If you have a float variable `my_float` with the value `7.8`, what action should you take to convert it to an integer and then print the result?

**Question 9:** Given an integer `my_integer` with a value of `42`, increment it by `7` and store the result in a variable called `result`. Then, print the value of `result`.

**Question 10:** Create a string variable `sentence` with the value `"This is a sample sentence."` Use string indexing to extract and print only the word `"sample"` from the sentence.

---

**Question 11:** Create a variable `x` with value `10` and `y` with value `5`. Subtract `y` from `x` and store the result in `difference`. Print it.

**Question 12:** What is the output and data type of `result = 5 / 2`?

**Question 13:** What is the output and data type of `result = 5 // 2`?

**Question 14:** Create a variable `text = "Learning Python is fun!"`. Use slicing to print only `"Python"`.

**Question 15:** Assign `is_active = False`. Use the `type()` function to print the data type of `is_active`.

**Question 16:** Use the `len()` function to find the number of characters in the string `"OpenAI"`.

**Question 17:** Create a variable `number = 15`. Use the `str()` function to convert it into a string and print its type.

**Question 18:** Create a variable `word = "banana"`. Replace all occurrences of `"a"` with `"o"` and print the new word.

**Question 19:** Create two variables `first = "Good"` and `second = "Morning"`. Join them with a space between using string concatenation and print the result.

**Question 20:** Given a string `quote = "Practice makes perfect"`, print whether the word `"perfect"` exists in the string using the `in` keyword.
