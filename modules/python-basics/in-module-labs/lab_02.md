### 1. Program to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd

```python
# Ask the user to input a number and store it in a variable
# Use an if-else statement to check if the number is divisible by 2
# If it is, print that the number is even
# Otherwise, print that it is odd
```

### 2. Program to Find the Largest of Two Numbers

```python
# Define two variables with any two numbers
# Use an if-else statement to compare them
# Print which number is larger (or if they are equal)
```

---

### 3. Program to Check If a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero

```python
# Ask the user to input a number
# Use an if-elif-else block to check:
# - If the number is greater than 0, print "Positive"
# - If it is less than 0, print "Negative"
# - Otherwise, print "Zero"
```

### 4. Program to Check Eligibility to Vote

```python
# Define a variable for the user's age (can be input or hardcoded)
# Use an if-else statement to check if the age is 18 or older
# If yes, print "Eligible to vote"
# Otherwise, print "Not eligible to vote"
```

### 5. Program to Check If a Year is a Leap Year

```python
# Define a variable for the year
# Use the following logic:
# - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4
# - But if it is also divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400
# Use if-elif-else to implement this condition
# Print whether the year is a leap year or not
```
